          Recently earned a certificate in full-stack development from the University of Richmond developing new skills in Javascript, Node.js, React.js, among others. 
          A detail-oriented and creative problem solver with a passion for programming results in a relentless approach to development demonstrated by my A average during the program. 
          I have 100+ hours experience developing using Javascript, and recently was lead on a project where I did 100% of the front end javascript that involved search functions, API calls, and storage of specific items called up.
